### I am not affiliated with DuckDuckGo, Startpage, or Swisscows. I just like their search engines and want to support them. I hope you enjoy this filterlist! :)

# Filterlist
Ublock Origin filter to support [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com), [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com) and [Swisscows](https://www.swisscows.com) by whitelisting their ads. 

# Why Whitelist Their Ads?
Both Startpage and Swisscows use privacy respecting contextual based advertisements. 

DuckDuckGo business model ([Ads by TripAdvisor on DuckDuckGo Private Search](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/ads-by-tripadvisor-on-duckduckgo-private-search/)) & ([Ads By Microsoft on DuckDuckGo Private Search](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/ads-by-microsoft-on-duckduckgo-private-search/))

Startpage business model ([blog post](https://www.startpage.com/privacy-please/startpage-articles/whats-startpages-revenue-model))

Swisscows business model ([Advertising at Swisscows](https://swisscows.com/en/privacy))

If you do not want to whitelist ads, just don't use this filterlist. Ublock Origin (with default settings) should block any and all ads.
